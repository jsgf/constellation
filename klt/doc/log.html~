<h1> Log of Changes </h1>

<ul>

<li> <em> Version 1.1.3 </em>
<ul>
<li> <em> 3/11/98 </em>
     <ul>
     <li> Posted.
     <li> Fixed bug in <code>KLTTrackFeatures()</code>.  In the
		conditional just after the call to <code>_trackFeature()</code>,
		<code>KLT_OOB</code> is now properly handled.
     <li> Slightly improved bounds-checking by introducing an epsilon,
		and by giving back an extra pixel along the border that had 
		been taken away unnecessarily.
	<li> If <tt>tc->window_[width,height]</tt> is unacceptable, 
		a warning is now generated and the value is corrected.  
		Previously an error was generated.
     <li> In Example 5, changed search range from 20 to 15.  As a
		result, if the window size is changed to 5 the number of 
		pyramid levels remains 2, which prevents the border from 
		increasing dramatically.
     <li> In Makefile, change example dependencies from lib to libklt.a.
		Unfortunately, changing the library source code (such as
		<code>trackFeatures.c</code>) and then calling <tt>make
		example1</tt> does not work properly, but at least
		changing <tt>example1.c</tt> and then calling <tt>make
		example1</tt> does work.  The latter case is probably more 
		important, so we will have to live with the current tradeoff.
	</ul>
</ul>

<li> <em> Version 1.1.2 </em>
<ul>
<li> <em> 2/24/98 </em>
     <ul>
     <li> Posted.
     <li> Fixed major bug:  Added an explicit check to ensure that feature
		does not drift out of bounds during tracking.  This removes the
		problem of occasional crashes.
     <li> Speeded up sorting by replacing qsort() with Manolis Lourakis' _quicksort() 
		function.
     <li> Added KLTSetVerbosity() to klt.c (It should have already been there)
     <li> Changed ppmWriteFile() to ppmWriteFileRGB()
     <li> Fixed minor bug:  assert() statement in line 314 of convolve.c
     <li> In Makefile, change example dependencies from libklt.a to lib
	</ul>
</ul>

<li> <em> Version 1.1.1 </em>
<ul>
<li> <em> 12/18/97 </em>
     <ul>
     <li> Posted.
     <li> Fixed minor syntax bug:  Changed 'if feof(fp)' to 'if (feof(fp))' in writeFeatures.c
     <li> Fixed major bug:  When tracking features, 'max_residue' was not
	 	being computed correctly.  Therefore, feature windows that changed
		a lot in intensity were not being detected.  Specifically, in
		trackFeatures.c, I changed _sumFloatWindow to _sumAbsFloatWindow.
	</ul>
</ul>

<li> <em> Version 1.1 </em>
<ul>
<li> <em> 10/16/97 </em>
	<ul> 
	<li> Fixed bug in pgmReadFile().  It was not skipping over the
		last return character.
	<li> Example 1 was updated to include binary files.
	<li> Changed KLTWriteFeature...() and KLTReadFeature...()
		to allow binary files, as well as text files.
	</ul> 
<li> <em> 10/15/97 </em>
	<ul> 
	<li> Posted
	<li> Fixed obscure bug in KLTChangeTCPyramid() and
		improved readability of that function
	<li> Fixed incorrect assert() statement in _interpolate() function
	</ul>
</ul>

<li> <em> Version 1.1 (beta) </em>
<ul>
<li> <em> 2/21/97 </em>
	<ul> 
	<li> Renamed as Version 1.1 (beta)
	</ul>
<li> <em> 2/15/97 </em>
	<ul>
	<li> Posted as Version 1.2 <br>
		(This was a mistake; it should have been named Version 1.1 (beta).)
	<li> Fixed obscure bug that sometimes caused infinite loop <br>
		(bug was in _enforceMinimumDistance() function of
		selectGoodFeatures.c)
	<li> Amended KLTPrintTrackingContext() to print all the new
		fields that were added in Version 1.1
	</ul>
</ul>

<li> <em> Version 1.1 (alpha) </em>
<ul>
<li> <em> 2/21/97 </em>
	<ul> Renamed as Version 1.1 (alpha) 
	</ul>
<li> <em> 2/10/97 </em>
	<ul>
	<li> Posted as Version 1.1 <br>
		(This was a mistake; it should have been named Version 1.1 (alpha).)
	<li> Features are lost when residue exceeded
	<li> KLTSelectGoodFeatures() only accepts features whose minimum
		eigenvalue is at least <code>tc->min_eigenvalue</code>
	<li> User allowed to output internal images
	<li> comments allowed in data files
	<li> Default for <code>tc->smooth_sigma_fact</code> changed from 0.5 to 0.1
	<li> Simplified _minEigenvalue() routine in selectGoodFeatures.c 
	</ul>
</ul>

<li> <em> Version 1.0 (beta) </em>
<ul>
<li> <em> 2/10/97 </em>
	<ul>
	<li> Posted
	<li> Print statements are prefaced by "(KLT) "
	</ul>
</ul>

<li> <em> Version 1.0 (alpha) </em>
<ul>
<li> <em> 1/28/97 </em>
	<ul>
	<li> Removed '#include "pyramid.h"' from "klt.h"
	<li> Changed '_KLT_Pyramid' in "klt.h" to 'void *'
	<li> Forced coercion of 'void *' to '_KLT_Pyramid' in other files
	</ul>
<li> <em> 1/27/97 </em>
	<dl>
	<dt> Removed 'makedepend' from Makefile, along with dependencies
		below '# DO NOT DELETE'
	</dl>
<li> <em> 1/24/97 </em>
	<dl>
	<dt> Posted
	</dl>

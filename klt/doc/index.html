<h1> KLT:  An Implementation of the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi Feature Tracker </h1>
<IMG SRC="http://www-cs.stanford.edu/gifs/line.blue3.gif" ALT="-----"><p>

KLT is an implementation, in the C programming language, of a feature 
tracker that will hopefully be of interest to the computer vision community.
The tracker is based on the early work of Lucas and 
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/tk/www/home.html">
Kanade</a>
[1] and was developed fully by 
<a href="http://flamingo.stanford.edu/users/tomasi/bio.html">
Tomasi</a>
and Kanade [2], but the only
published, readily accessible description is contained in the paper by
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jshi/">
Shi </a>
and Tomasi [3].  
Recently, Tomasi proposed a slight modification which
makes the computation symmetric with respect to the two images; the
resulting equation is fully derived
in the unpublished note by 
<a href="http://vision.stanford.edu/~birch">
Birchfield </a> 
[4].<p>

Briefly, good features are located by examining the minimum
eigenvalue of each 2 by 2 gradient matrix, and features are
tracked using a Newton-Raphson method of minimizing the difference
between the two windows.  
Multiresolution tracking allows for even large displacements between
images.
Currently, the affine computation that evaluates the consistency
of features between non-consecutive frames [3] 
is not implemented. <p>

<h1>Constellation</h1>
<h2>As seen at Maker Faire!</h2>

<p>Constellation gives particpants the ability to create, move and
destroy stars, and be part of a network of constellations.  It
operates interactively in real time, from a live video feed.

<p>Constellation is one application of the Bokchoi interactive video
manipulation system.  Visual effects can be easily constructed by
writing programs in the Lua scripting language.

<p>More soon!
